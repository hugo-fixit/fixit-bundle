# FixIt Bundle

ðŸŒ² Include FixIt core theme and every FixIt theme components in one bundle component.

## Install Component

The installation method is the same as [installing a theme](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/documentation/installation/). There are several ways to install, choose one, for example, install through Hugo Modules:

### Install as Hugo Module

First make sure that your project itself is a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/#initialize-a-new-module).

Then add this theme component to your `hugo.toml` configuration file:

```toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/hugo-fixit/fixit-bundle"
```

On the first start of Hugo it will download the required files.

To update to the latest version of the module run:

```bash
hugo mod get -u
hugo mod tidy
```

### Install as Git Submodule

Clone [FixIt](https://github.com/hugo-fixit) and this git repository into your theme folder and add it as submodules of your website directory.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-fixit/fixit-bundle.git themes/fixit-bundle
```

Next edit `hugo.toml` of your project and add this theme component to your themes:

```toml
theme = ["fixit-bundle"]
```
